The crew was able to ditch the plane in the Hudson River, making a soft landing. All 150 passengers and crew of 5 made it out safely before the plane began to sink. No one was reported to be seriously injured.'\n",

      " \"The aircraft was believed to have gone into a spin or spiral dive with recovery at about 12,000 ft. The dive apparently caused structural damage which resulted in the aircraft plunging into St George's Channel, 10 miles east of Carnsore Point. Possible causal factors may have been metal fatigue, corrosion, flutter (vibration) or a bird strike.\"\n",

The aircraft collided with a large flock of lapwings and starlings, causing failure of the No. 1, 2, and 3 engines after which the port wing hit the ground and the plane exploded in flames. Aboard were members of a  Dutch Army Band returning from Italy.'\n",
      " 'During takeoff, the aircraft ingested numerous pigeons into both engines. One engine lost thrust almost immediately and the second lost thrust during the emergency return to the airport. The aircraft crashed while trying to land. Engine failure due to ingestion of 10-16 Columba Guinea birds.'\n",
      " 'The aircraft suffered multiple bird strikes in the No. 1 and 2 engines just after taking off when it flew into a flock of 100 or more Canada Geese. The crew initiated a slow climb and began to dump fuel. The aircraft attained a maximum altitude of 250 ft. before it started to descend. The plane impacted a hilly wooded area less than a mile from the runway, broke up, exploded and burned.  Ingestion of Canada geese into the Nos.1 and 2 engines. Lack of adequate procedures to reduce bird hazards. The crew was not warned about observations of birds in the area by the ATC.'\n",
      " 'A few seconds after becoming airborne, the aircraft struck a flock of starlings. A number of these birds were ingested in engines No. 1, 2, and 4.  Engine No. 1 was shut down and its propeller was feathered. Engines No. 2 and 4 experienced a substantial momentary loss of power. This abrupt and intermittent loss and recovery of power resulted in the aircraft yawing to the left and decelerating to the stall speed. As speed decayed during the continued yaw and skidding left turn, the stall speed was reached; the left wing dropped, the nose pitched up, and the aircraft rolled left into a spin and fell almost vertically into the water. An altitude of less than 150 feet precluded recovery.'\n",
      " 'The aircraft penetrated a flock of Whistling Swans at 6,000 ft. One, estimated to be 13 pounds, struck the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer, weakening the structure and causing it to detach. The aircraft lost control and broke-up in mid-air and crashed. Bird collision.']\n"
